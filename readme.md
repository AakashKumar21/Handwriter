No one loves writing assignments (except some diamonds), so I made this tool to convert text into realistic looking handwritten text.

# Output

# How to Install

- Download Python 3

- Clone this repo

- Inside repo folder install python dependencies by 

  ``` python
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

# How to use

## Creating custom font

You will need custom font for your handwriting, use https://www.calligraphr.com/, But this tool is free for only 75 characters, so what you can do is pay ðŸ˜¶, kidding. 
Create Two font packs for **Alphabets + Numbers** and **Symbols**. 
Now using a https://fontforge.org/ you can merge that two font into one.
Paste the font in repo folder

## Using the CLI

``` python 
python3 handwriter.py text_file1.txt text_file_2.txt ... font_file.ttf
# For example
python3 handwriter.py assignment1.txt myfont.ttf
python3 handwriter.py assignment1.txt assignment2.txt myfont.ttf
```

This will generate PDF files in pdf folder with same name as text file

## Configuring output generation

For now you can change variables in config.py to suit your needs. Each handwriting may require different configuration.

For making this tool more robust, adding GUI and making a good readme :).
